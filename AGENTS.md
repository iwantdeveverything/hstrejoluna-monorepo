# Coding Standards & Guidelines

This project uses **Gentleman Guardian Angel** to ensure high code quality and consistency. All contributions must adhere to these standards.

## General Principles
- **Clean Code:** Prioritize readability and simplicity.
- **Type Safety:** Use TypeScript for all JavaScript projects. Avoid `any`.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Extract common logic into reusable functions or components.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Avoid over-engineering.

## Style Guidelines
- **Naming:** Use camelCase for variables/functions and PascalCase for components/classes.
- **Formatting:** Adhere to Prettier/ESLint rules if configured.
- **Comments:** Write self-documenting code; use comments only for complex logic.

## AI Agent Behavior
- **Be Concise:** Provide brief, actionable feedback.
- **Be Constructive:** Explain the "why" behind suggested changes.
- **Check for Performance:** Flag inefficient loops or memory-intensive operations.
- **GitHub MCP First:** Use GitHub MCP tools as the primary interface for issues/PR/workflow operations.
