# In-Place Expansion Grids Specification

## Purpose

Defines the requirements for rendering categorized content (Projects, Experience, Skills) in responsive grids that can dynamically expand selected rows to reveal highly detailed nested interfaces without triggering a new URL or overlay modal.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Responsive Grid Construction

The system MUST lay out content nodes in a CSS grid structure varying from 1 to 3 columns depending on device breakpoint viewport size.

#### Scenario: Mobile grid scaling
- GIVEN a mobile viewport (`< 768px`)
- WHEN the Projects overview grid is rendered
- THEN it MUST present 1 unified column of items

#### Scenario: Desktop grid scaling
- GIVEN a desktop viewport (`>= 1024px`)
- WHEN the Projects overview grid is rendered
- THEN it MUST present 3 unified columns of items

### Requirement: In-Place Expansion Unrolling

The system MUST expand the detail view directly underneath the clicked target, temporarily displacing subsequent siblings without overlapping.

#### Scenario: Selection expansion
- GIVEN a grid of items
- WHEN a user clicks on an unexpanded item "A"
- THEN item "A" MUST set its state to expanded, revealing a sub-panel
- AND the sub-panel MUST push the bounding grid layout organically downwards
- AND the container MUST transition its height gracefully (`AnimatePresence`)

### Requirement: Singular Expansion Mode

The system SHOULD automatically collapse previously expanded items within the same category to maintain scroll sanity when a new item is selected.

#### Scenario: Selecting consecutive items
- GIVEN item "A" is currently expanded
- WHEN a user clicks on item "B" in the same exact grid
- THEN item "A" MUST unconditionally collapse back to an atomic overview state
- AND item "B" MUST subsequently expand its detail view
